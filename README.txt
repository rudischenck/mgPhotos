Welcome to Rudi's Code Louisville project!

This is the home page for a photography website.

Built a fully responsive layout with bootstrap and some custom styling for the page in css/styles.css

For the JavaScript portion, I decided to write a small program that prints a different word for a
positive emotion, feeling, or value whenever the photo carousel slides to a new slide.
